For the coursework assignment, we decided to study DNS rebinding attacks.
A DNS rebinding attack is an exploit in which an attacker subverts
the same-origin policy of browsers, by running a client-side script used to
attack target machines on a network, and converts them into open network
proxies~\cite{jackson2009protecting}. This allows attackers to
breach private networks, as well as use a victim machine for distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks amongst other malicious activities.

We used a DNS rebinding attack to exploit a vulnerability in the Transmission
Bittorrent client (pre version 2.9.3), which leads to the execution of arbitrary
code on the target machine running the Bittorrent client. This report describes
our implementation of a DNS rebinding attack~\cite{cve20185702} which is
demonstrated using two Virtual Machines (VMs) running Ubuntu 17.10, where one of
the VMs plays the role of an attacker and the other, the role of a victim.
