\chapter{Domain Name System (DNS)}

DNS is a protocol within the TCP/IP protocol suite (which defines how
devices exchange data on the Internet). It is described as a "hierarchical
decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources
connected to the Internet or a private
network"~\cite{dnswiki}.

The DNS associates a human-friendly domain name with a corresponding IP
address. The DNS identifies and locates devices and resources on the Internet
or a private network. For instance, when a URL is entered on a web browser the
DNS will match it with the IP address of the appropriate machine which is
running the HTTP service serving the web page. This is why entering both
\url{https://137.195.101.204/} and \url{https://www.hw.ac.uk} into a browser
will result in the same web page being displayed.
