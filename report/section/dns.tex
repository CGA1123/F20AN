\chapter{Domain Name System (DNS)}

DNS is a protocol within the TCP/IP protocol suite, which defines how devices exchange
data on the Internet. It is described as a "hierarchical decentralized
naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
Internet or a private network"\textsuperscript{\cite{dnswiki}}.

A DNS associates a domain name with a corresponding IP address. The DNS
identifies and locates devices and resources on the Internet or a private
network, for instance when a URL is entered on a web browser the DNS will
match it with an IP address for that location and setup a connection.
